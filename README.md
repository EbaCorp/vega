# Getting started with EBA VEGA

This is a simple implementation of using `python-espeak` open-source library.

First things first. Your system should have `Python 2`. Then install dependencies `pip` and `virtualenv`.

## Dependencies

Project is using `python-espeak`.

## How to run

Enter to the local environment profile by typing:

```
virtualenv `my-project` && cd my-project && source bin/activate
```

Run `python-espeak` package installation by typing:

```
pip install python-espeak
```

Finally, run python file with all the code in:

```
python voice_test.py
```

That's it pretty much.
